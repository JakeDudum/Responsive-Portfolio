                Hi my name, if you couldn't already tell, is Jake Dudum. Welcome to my website! I am a San Francisco native, but moved to San Bruno about 15 years ago. I am currently attending UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp in San Francisco at 160 Spear Street, unit room 602. I plan to utilize the knowledge and experience gained at the bootcamp to jumpstart my career into web development.

                On a more personal note, I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, and geeking out about anything Marvel related. I'm not really a sports guy, but I do always root for the 49ers and Giants whenver they play. My favorite video game by far would have to be Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Seige, while my favorite anime is HunterxHunter, and Avengers: Endgame was geekfest for me. Outside of my hobbies I also enjoy walking and playing with my two dogs, Rocky and Road and yes they were named in that order after the ice cream flavor my mom loves.
